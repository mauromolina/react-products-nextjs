This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Information

This SSR application was created with ReactJS as part of my learning with React Hooks, Next.js, Firebase and reinforcing design knowledge with Styled Components. It is a simple page that includes Authentication, Storage, Database and Hosting in Firebase for a clone of the Product Hunt site.

### Preview

The app is now live on: [Firebase Hosting](https://mmhunt-react.web.app/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
